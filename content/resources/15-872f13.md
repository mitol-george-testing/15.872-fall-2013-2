description: "The story of the Vasa is an example of a large-scale project gone bad.\
  \ In 1628 the Swedish warship sank in the harbor approximately twenty minutes into\
  \ her maiden voyage. A late request for additional gunpower, what is known now as\
  \ a late customer specification change, and pressure to launch quickly contributed\
  \ to the failure. Image of the Vasa ship at the Vasa Museum in Stockholm courtesy\
